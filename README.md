## Website Vulnerability Scanner in Python
## by Bryan Arnold

### Planning & Considerations

 - Define the Scope:
Determine the types of vulnerabilities you want to scan for and the technologies your scanner will support (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.). Decide whether you want to focus on specific platforms or offer a broader solution.

 - Web Crawler:
Develop a web crawler that navigates through the target website, discovering and collecting URLs for further scanning. Ensure it can handle different types of pages, authentication mechanisms, and various URL structures.

 - HTTP Requests and Responses:
Implement the logic to send HTTP requests to the target URLs and capture the corresponding responses. This will involve handling cookies, sessions, redirects, and other HTTP-related features.

 - Vulnerability Detection:
Implement detection mechanisms for the vulnerabilities you want to scan for. This may involve pattern matching, data validation, or code analysis techniques depending on the type of vulnerability.

 - Static Analysis:
Perform static analysis of the target website's source code to identify potential vulnerabilities. This step requires parsing the code, analyzing the logic, and applying security rules to detect issues like insecure coding practices or vulnerable library versions.

 - Dynamic Analysis:
Execute test cases against the target website to identify vulnerabilities that can only be discovered through interaction. This includes techniques like fuzzing, input validation testing, and analyzing server responses for anomalies.

 - Reporting:
Generate comprehensive and detailed reports that summarize the vulnerabilities found, their severity, and recommendations for remediation. Consider providing proof-of-concept examples to help developers understand and reproduce the issues.

 - Updates and Maintenance:
Keep your vulnerability scanner up to date with the latest security vulnerabilities and patches. Maintain a database of known vulnerabilities and regularly update it to ensure effective scanning.

 - Authentication and Session Management:
Incorporate mechanisms to handle websites that require authentication or session management. This could involve capturing and replaying login sequences or handling authentication tokens.

 - Performance Considerations:
Optimize your scanner for performance to handle large-scale scans efficiently. This may involve implementing concurrency, rate limiting, or other techniques to avoid overloading the target website.

 - Legal and Ethical Considerations:
Ensure that your vulnerability scanner complies with legal and ethical guidelines. Obtain proper authorization from website owners before conducting scans and respect their policies regarding scanning activities.

### Steps

#### SCANNER

    Crawler

 - The Crawler class is defined to encapsulate the crawling functionality.
 - The crawl method initiates the crawling process by providing the target URL and the maximum depth to crawl.
 - The _crawl_recursive method is a helper function that performs the actual crawling recursively.
 - The crawler keeps track of visited URLs in the visited_urls set to avoid revisiting the same URL.
 - The _is_valid_url method checks if a URL is valid based on scheme, domain, and path criteria.
 - The _process_response method is used to perform additional processing on the response, such as extracting relevant information or parsing the source code. In this example, it collects the URLs of web pages containing source code for further analysis.
 - The get_source_code_paths method returns the list of source code paths found during the crawling process.

    Dynamic Anyalisis

- The DynamicAnalyzer class is designed to perform dynamic analysis on web page source code to detect potential vulnerabilities.
- The analyze method orchestrates the dynamic analysis process by taking a target URL and a list of source code paths as input.
- The _fetch_source_code method emulates fetching the source code from a URL and returns the source code content.
- The _find_vulnerabilities method simulates identifying vulnerabilities within the source code and returns a list of detected vulnerabilities.
- The vulnerabilities are stored in the vulnerabilities attribute for further analysis or reporting.

    HTTP

- The HTTPClient class encapsulates HTTP-related functionality for sending HTTP GET and POST requests.
- The get method performs an HTTP GET request and returns the response.
- The post method performs an HTTP POST request and returns the response.
- The send_request method is a generic method that supports various HTTP methods. It returns the response based on the provided HTTP method.
- The close method closes the HTTP session when the HTTPClient instance is no longer needed.

    Report

- The ReportGenerator class encapsulates the functionality to generate vulnerability reports.
- The add_vulnerability method allows adding individual vulnerabilities to the report.
- The generate_report method generates a formatted vulnerability report based on the added vulnerabilities.
- The report includes a header indicating the type of report and a message if no vulnerabilities are found.
- The vulnerabilities are enumerated with index numbers and corresponding vulnerability descriptions.

#### TESTS

    Crawler

 - unittest is imported to utilize the testing framework.
 - The TestCrawler class inherits from unittest.TestCase to define the test cases.
 - The setUp method is used to create an instance of the Crawler class before each test case.
 - The test_crawl method tests the crawl functionality. It sets a target URL and maximum depth, and then verifies the number of visited URLs and specific URLs within the expected levels.
 - The test_get_source_code_paths method tests the get_source_code_paths functionality. It sets the source code paths and verifies the number of paths and their correctness.

To run the tests, you can execute the test_crawler.py file directly, or use a test runner like unittest's built-in test runner or external runners like pytest or nose.

    Dynamic Anyalisis

- The unittest module is imported to utilize the testing framework for dynamic analysis.
- The TestDynamicAnalyzer class is a test case that inherits from unittest.TestCase and defines various test scenarios.
- The setUp method is utilized to create an instance of the DynamicAnalyzer class before each test case for isolation.
- The test_analyze_finds_vulnerabilities method validates if the analyze method of the DynamicAnalyzer class successfully detects vulnerabilities in a simulated source code. It sets up a mock response using the _fetch_source_code method and asserts the presence of the expected vulnerability in the detected vulnerabilities list.
- Similar to the actual dynamic analysis, the test methods emulate the dynamic analysis process and verify its correctness.

    HTTP

- The unittest module is imported to utilize the testing framework for HTTP functionality.
- The TestHTTPClient class is a test case that inherits from unittest.TestCase and defines test scenarios for the HTTPClient class.
- The setUp method initializes an instance of the HTTPClient class before each test method.
- The tearDown method closes the HTTP session after each test method to ensure proper cleanup.
- The test_get_request method simulates an HTTP GET request using mocked responses and asserts the correctness of the response attributes.
- The test_post_request method simulates an HTTP POST request using mocked responses and asserts the correctness of the response attributes.
- The test_send_request_invalid_method method tests the behavior of the send_request method when an invalid HTTP method is provided, confirming that it raises a ValueError.
- The test methods emulate HTTP functionality and verify the correctness of the HTTPClient class.

    Report

- The unittest module is imported to utilize the testing framework for report functionality.
- The TestReportGenerator class is a test case that inherits from unittest.TestCase and defines test scenarios for the ReportGenerator class.
- The setUp method initializes an instance of the ReportGenerator class before each test method.
- The test_generate_report_no_vulnerabilities method tests if the generate_report method correctly generates a report when no vulnerabilities are added. It compares the generated report with the expected report.
- The test_generate_report_with_vulnerabilities method tests if the generate_report method correctly generates a report with added vulnerabilities. It adds vulnerabilities, generates the report, and compares it with the expected report.
- The test methods emulate report functionality and verify the correctness of the ReportGenerator class.

MAIN.PY

1. Import the necessary modules and classes from your scanner components.

2. Define the main() function as the entry point of your vulnerability scanner.

3. Configure settings such as the target website URL and maximum crawling depth.

4. Initialize the necessary scanner components such as the crawler, HTTP client, vulnerability scanner, static analyzer, dynamic analyzer, and report generator.

5. Perform the scanning process step by step:
- Use the crawler component to crawl the target website and retrieve the URLs to scan.
- Use the static analyzer to perform static analysis on the source code of the website.
- Use the vulnerability scanner to scan each URL and detect vulnerabilities in the responses.
- Use the dynamic analyzer to perform dynamic analysis on the target website.
- Use the report generator to generate a vulnerability report based on the crawled URLs, static analysis results, detected vulnerabilities, and dynamic analysis results.

6. Save the vulnerability report to a file (e.g., HTML format) using the save() method provided by the report generator.

7. In the if __name__ == "__main__": block, call the main() function to start the scanning process when the script is run directly.
